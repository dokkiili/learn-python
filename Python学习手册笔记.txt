Part 3 || Chapter 15    Python Docs
========================
1. Where can find Python Docs resources ?
Comment in Python file  : start with "#" this is a single line comment.
dir() :  return a list of the object's  attributes.
docstring : __doc__
Python Doc : help()
Standard manual set
Web Resources / Books

2. How to get detailed information about the attributes of an object ?
__doc__ : module docstring is on the *.py head; function and class docstring place in head in 
function / class body respectively.
Eg. Module.__doc__; Module.func.__doc__;Module.cls.__doc__;Module.cls.method.__doc__;

help() : Auto generate module info in specific way.
Python Module Document : all

Part 4 || Chapter 16  Function Basics
0. function is  a packaged procedure invoked by its name,
functions are also basic program structure Python provide for maximizing
code reuse,which split complex complex systems into manageable parts.
declare function        -->   def / lambda
scope visibility           -->   global / nonlocal
come results              -->   return / yield

1.How to create function ?
def statements are coded in module files and run to generate functions when
the module file first imported.
def create an function object and assigns it to a name [function name]
lambda  create an object but return it as a result.
return sends a result object back to caller. A return without a value will return 
None,the default value.
yield send a result object back to the caller,but remember where it left off.[generators]

2. Variable Visibility Scope 
global declare module-level variables that are to be assigned,which can be used to retain 
state - information remembered between functions call,without by sharing
global names.
Function's arguments ,return values and variables are not declare and no type constraints,
which mean that they can be any types.
function definition happens at Python runtime.
By the large,we code to object interfaces in Python,not data types.By implementing method,any 
object can be applied the polymorphism operations. 
Checking the types of object passed into function breaks the function's flexibility,
constraining the function to work on specific types only.

=================================
Chapter 17  Scopes
=================================

The Python's scope is place where variables defined and decided the meaning of variable in code.
all assigned inside a function are associated with function's namespace. 
functions define a local scope and modules define a global scope
